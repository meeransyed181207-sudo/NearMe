        <hr><font color="white">V.O.C. Nagar Railway Station (VOC) is a suburban station in Chennai, part of the Chennai Central-Gummidipoondi line, known for serving the Tondiarpet area and a large railway yard, often used by railway employees and railfans, with limited basic amenities but good bus connectivity to the city. It was formerly the Tondiarpet Marshalling Yard and is located north of Chennai Central, featuring electrified lines and platforms for local EMU services, but sees few long-distance trains.</font>
